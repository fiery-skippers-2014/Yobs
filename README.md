#YOBS

===========

Yobs is where the non-profit youth job training programs of San Francisco can post their job training programs in one central place so the most disenfranchised youth can easily find them using only their smartphone.  With just a few clicks youth will be connected to all the programs available in the city.  

Currently the different non-profit job training programs have their own separate application process.  If a youth wants to find what subsidized jobs are available they need to reach out separately to each of the different programs.  Many of these non-profits have no online job postings, and no postings that are easy to read using a cell phone.  Given that many of the most hard to reach youth don't have access to laptops or home computers, the number one access point is going to be a cell phone.  

Yobs is designed to be mobile force and to reduce the barriers between youth and the jobs available for them.
